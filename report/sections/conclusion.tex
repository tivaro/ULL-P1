\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we reproduced the unigram model of \cite{Goldwater200921} and attempted to replicate their results. While we were unable to exactly match their results, our results generally seem to agree with their results. Moreover, our results show that our model suffers from the same problem as their unigram model, namely that it tends to under-segment the corpus. This confirms their main finding that the word-to-word independence assumption is inadequate and should be dropped or changed.
Extending the DP unigram model to a PYP model did decrease the performance. Further research should investigate what causes this effect.
