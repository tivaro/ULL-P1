Experiments can be run in command line by using the experiments module.
For more information on how to set which parameters, use the following command:

python experiments.py -h

results will be put in the results folder in .json files

to run all experiments we ran, use the following command:
python experiments.py -runall

plot_experiments will make plots for every .json file in the results folder

The report is located in report/report.pdf

Due to the large size, not all files are added.
